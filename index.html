    <p> Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of intelligent machines that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. It involves the creation of computer systems capable of acquiring and processing information, learning from it, and making decisions or taking actions based on that knowledge. AI can be categorized into three main types: narrow or weak AI, general or strong AI, and superintelligent AI. Narrow AI focuses on specific tasks and is designed to excel in a limited domain, such as voice assistants or image recognition systems. General AI, on the other hand, aims to possess human-like intelligence and capabilities across various domains, enabling it to perform a wide range of tasks. Superintelligent AI surpasses human intelligence and has the potential to outperform humans in virtually all cognitive tasks. While narrow AI is currently prevalent and actively used in various fields, the development of general and superintelligent AI remains a subject of ongoing research and exploration.</p>
    
    <h2>3 main domains where AI plays a vital role</h2>

        <span id="health"><img src="Health_icon.png" alt=""></span>
        Healthcare: AI has revolutionized healthcare by enabling faster and more accurate diagnoses, personalized treatment plans, and drug discovery. It has the potential to analyze vast amounts of medical data, assist in radiology image interpretation, predict disease outcomes, and even support surgical procedures. AI-powered technologies enhance patient care, improve efficiency, and contribute to better health outcomes.

        <span id="finance"><img src="Finance_icon.png" alt=""></span>
        Finance: AI has transformed the financial industry by automating routine tasks, detecting fraudulent activities, and providing personalized financial advice. Machine learning algorithms can analyze complex data patterns to predict market trends, optimize investment portfolios, and perform risk assessments. AI chatbots and virtual assistants enhance customer service by providing real-time support and personalized recommendations. 
    </p>
    <p >
        <span id="transportation"><img src="Transportation_icon.png" alt=""></span>
        Transportation: AI has a significant impact on transportation, particularly with the emergence of autonomous vehicles. Self-driving cars leverage AI technologies, such as computer vision and machine learning, to perceive their surroundings, make driving decisions, and navigate safely. AI also plays a role in optimizing traffic management systems, predicting maintenance needs, and improving logistics and route planning for transportation networks.

        <h3>Governance of superintelligence</h3>
        <p> Given the picture as we see it now, it's conceivable that within the next ten years, AI systems will exceed expert skill level in most domains, and carry out as much productive activity as one of today's largest corporations.</p>
        <p>In terms of both potential upsides and downsides, superintelligence will be more powerful than other technologies humanity has had to contend with in the past. We can have a dramatically more prosperous future; but we have to manage risk to get there. Given the possibility of existential risk, we can't just be reactive. Nuclear energy is a commonly used historical example of a technology with this property; synthetic biology is another example.</p> 
        <p>We must mitigate the risks of today's AI technology too, but superintelligence will require special treatment and coordination</p>
